# **Options Pricing Models**

### **Introduction**

Objective:
To understand and implement option pricing models using Python.
To analyze the impact of different parameters on option pricing.

Importance:
Option pricing models are fundamental in financial derivatives, providing crucial insights for traders, investors, and risk managers.
Accurate pricing models help in making informed decisions, hedging risks, and maximizing returns.

Basics of Options:
* Call Option: The right to buy an asset at a specified price within a specified time.
* Put Option: The right to sell an asset at a specified price within a specified time.

### **The Black-Scholes Model**

In finance, the Black-Scholes-Merton Model is one of the most widely used methods for pricing options. It calculates the theoritical value of an option based on five key variables:

**Key Parameters**:

*   Underlying Asset Price (S)
*   Strike Price (K)
*   Time to Expiration or Maturity (T)
*   Risk - Free Interest Rate (r)
*   Volatility (Ïƒ)


### Black-Scholes Assumptions

The Black-Scholes model makes certain assumptions:

* No dividends are paid out during the life of the option.
* Markets are random (i.e., market movements cannot be predicted).
* There are no transaction costs in buying the option.
* The risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying asset are known and constant.
* The returns of the underlying asset are normally distributed.
* The option is European and can only be exercised at expiration.

### Option's Greeks
* An option's Greeks describe its various risk parameters.
* Delta is a measure of the change in an option's price or premium resulting from a change in the underlying asset, while theta measures its price decay as time passes.
* Gamma measures the delta's rate of change over time, as well as the rate of change in the underlying asset, and helps forecast price moves in the underlying asset.
* Vega measures the risk of changes in implied volatility or the forward-looking expected volatility of the underlying asset price.
* Theta measures time decay in the value of an option or its premium.

### Profitability
* An at-the-money option means that the option's strike price and the underlying asset's price are equal
* An in-the-money option means that a profit exists because the option's strike price is more favorable than the underlying asset's price
* An out-of-the-money (OTM) option means that no profit exists when comparing the option's strike price to the price of the underlying asset

### Binomial Options Pricing Model

The Binomial Options Pricing Model, introduced by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979, provides a discrete-time framework for valuing options. It models the underlying asset price movements through a binomial tree, where each node represents potential price changes (up or down) over time.

#### Key Features
* **Discrete Time Steps:** Divides the option's life into multiple periods.
* **Binomial Tree:** Represents possible future asset prices at each step.
* **Flexibility:** Can handle American options and varying conditions.

#### Comparison with Black-Scholes Model
* **Time Framework:** Binomial is discrete, while Black-Scholes is continuous.
* **Flexibility:** Binomial can price American options; Black-Scholes primarily handles European options.
* **Complexity:** Binomial is computationally intensive for many steps; Black-Scholes provides a closed-form solution.

The Binomial Model's flexibility makes it a powerful tool for various option types and market conditions, complementing the more straightforward Black-Scholes Model.
